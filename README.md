# boot-syu
This is a tool for updating the dependency list in a project's build.boot file. Inspired by ```pacman -Syu```, boot-syu simply replaces dependencies with the latest versions available. 

[ancient-clj](https://github.com/xsc/ancient-clj) is used for the core artifact retrieval.

At the moment only clojars jars will be updated.
